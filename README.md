This is an exercise from a tutoril by TrentDoesMath
It uses an excel file of sales data that is cleaned, engineered and then visualized to 
demonstrate how KMeans and silhouette scores are developed and used and it is a good example
There is a page two of the spreadsheet that can be used to replicate the tutorial processes
in another example
Here is a link to the github for this tutorial:  [https://github.com/trentpark8800/](https://github.com/trentpark8800/online-retail-data-clustering)
Here is the link to the data. It is large so not posted up here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii
